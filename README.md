# Summer-Project-2020
These are some of the codes I use in the Summer Project 2020, at UCLA.
The project is part of CSST 2020.

The folders "Block Structure" and "Tree Structure" give tests on ZORO with structure-aware gradient estimation.

The folder "Sensing Matrix Tests" gives tests on block diagonal sensing matrix and circulant matrix in CoSaMP.

The folder "ZORO_py" is the python version of ZORO

The folder "BCD Tests" gives tests on block coordinate descent ZORO.

The folder "Comparison" gives tests on comparison for full GD with BD, circulant and block circulant matrix, and BCD for BD and block circulant matrix.

The folder "Block_ZORO" gives the newest version of all tests above.

The folder "DWT Attack" gives test on adversarial attack by ZORO.

Run Test_Zeroth_Order_GD for experiments
