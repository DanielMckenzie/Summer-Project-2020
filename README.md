# Summer-Project-2020
These are some of the codes I use in the Summer Project 2020, at UCLA.
The project is part of CSST 2020.

The folders "Block Structure" and "Tree STructure" give tests on ZORO with structure-aware gradient estimation.

The folder "Sensing Matrix Tests" give tests on block diagonal sensing matrix and circulant matrix in CoSaMP.

The folder "ZORO_py" is the python version of ZORO

The folder "BCD Tests" give tests on block coordinate descent ZORO.
